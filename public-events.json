With additional funding from ArcelorMittal Dofasco‚Äôs Corporate Community Fund, Green Cities Foundation, Rain Haven, and Tree Canada, we transformed over 2000 sq feet of lawn, pavement, and concrete into an urban green space filled with 500+ native species and trees. This guided rain garden tour and plant walk will allow you to explore the new rain gardens at Laidlaw Memorial United Church and learn about the design and plant selection from the Landscape Architect, Adele Pierre.
